		<!-- <p>Hi there! 
		My name is Mallory Coleman and I'm 20 years old. I'm a canadian girl born from a small town of Listowel Ontario. I'm currently enrolled in Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College at London Ontario. I'm really enjoying my program as it is my first year. I spend a lot of my time with friends, family, and or doing homework whenever free time is possible. I also really enjoy going to the gym because I care about physical fitness. My favorite food would be anything with cheese or cheese sticks.</p>

		Friends, Horror movies, Fitness, Tv shows such as Outlander, This is Us, and The Good Doctor. I also enjoy art and going out with friends. </p> -->
